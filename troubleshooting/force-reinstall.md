# Steam workshop : File Management Issues

Steam workshop file management can be stubborn and junky. You may want to force Steam to re-download CFP if...
* The mod is activated but won't start.
* There are missing CFP assets in the barbershop when CFP is the only mod running.

**Option 0:** The mod won't update after an update drops : restart Steam.

**Option 1:** unsubscribe, launch the game, let the steam workshop update, close the game, resubscribe, reopen the game and let it update again.

**Option 2:** go to "_steamapps\workshop\content\1158310\2220098919_" and shift+delete all content in there. Then unsubscribe and resubscribe.

**Option 2b:** go to "_steamapps\workshop\content\1158310\2220098919_" and shift+delete all content in there. Then overwrite with the latest files from [Direct Download](/pages/releases).

**Option 3:** if CFP does not boot at game start, try checking [CK3 Launcher issue](/troubleshooting/ck-launcher).
