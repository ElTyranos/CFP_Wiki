# CK3 Launcher issue

If you launch the game and no mod will work, try this after closing the game and the launcher :
* delete the file `Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\launcher-v2.sqlite`
* run the game up, go in "all mods" tab and hit the "reload all mods" button. Now boot the game and see if mods are available to you.
