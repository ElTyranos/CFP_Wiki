# CK3 Launcher issue

If you launch the game and no mod will work, try this.
**WARNING: This is the last possible procedure.** Check home for other options before!

* **delete the file `Documents/paradox/CK3/mods_registry.json`**
* **delete the file `Documents/paradox/CK3/launcher-v2.sqlite`**
* **run the game up and see if mods are now available to you.**
