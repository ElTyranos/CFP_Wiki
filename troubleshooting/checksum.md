# Checksum is not matching in multiplayer

## A checksum will be different if...
* Files are different (both mods or game)
* Mods load order are different

## In order to solve a checksum issue, execute in following order...
* Verify vanilla game's files via steam (right click > properties > local files)
* Always besure you have the same load order as your friend(s)
* Run the game, host a local multiplayer lobby and go in the. Community Flavor Pack should be listed. If not, report to [CK3 Launcher re-init](/troubleshooting/ck-launcher)

* If Community Flavor Pack boots for everyone and there's still a mismatch, report to [Steam Workshop : force reinstall](/troubleshooting/force-reinstall)
