# Bug report procedure

1. Before reporting, the issue must be reproduced with CFP being the only mod in your playset.
2. The issue happens again ? You can now [Report it](https://github.com/ElTyranos/CommunityFlavorPack/issues). Thank you.

## Frequent issues

## A possible incompatibility ?
Several common issues should trigger your "mod incompatibility" warning light
* I see a lot of people **naked** and/or **bald** and/or **without headgear** : [Force re-install](/troubleshooting/force-reinstall). If issues persist, you have a mod incompatibility.
* There are missing CFP assets in the barbershop when you have several mods running.
* Some vanilla or CFP systems are broken.
* The more obvious the issue is, the more likely it's an incompatibility

### But, why ?
Unfortunately, the way the game is coded does not allow to append code (e.g. to change a very specific class or value), you have to overwrite actual game files entirely. [If two mods change the same files](/pages/vanilla-changes), they will create incompatibilities. There is nothing that can be done excepted one thing : [cooperation and compatibility patches between mods](/troubleshooting/in-compatibilities).
