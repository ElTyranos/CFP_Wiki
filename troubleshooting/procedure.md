# Bug report procedure

1. Before reporting, the issue must be reproduced with CFP being the only mod in your playset.
2. The issue happens again ? You can now [Report it](https://github.com/ElTyranos/CommunityFlavorPack/issues). Thank you.

_Read bellow why I'm asking you to do this._

## A possible incompatibility ?
Several common issues should trigger your "mod incompatibility" warning light
* I see plenty naked characters.
* There are missing CFP assets in the barbershop when you have several mods running.
* Some vanilla or CFP systems are broken.
* The more obvious the issue is, the more likely it's an incompatibility

### But, why ?
Unfortunately, the way the game is coded does not allow to append code (e.g. to change a very specific class or value), you have to overwrite actual game files entirely. [If two mods change the same files](https://github.com/ElTyranos/CommunityFlavorPack/wiki/Edited-vanilla-files), they will create incompatibilities. There is nothing that can be done excepted one thing : [cooperation and compatibility patches between mods](https://github.com/ElTyranos/CommunityFlavorPack/wiki/Known-(in)compatibilities).
