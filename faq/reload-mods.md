# Why is there a version mismatch warning sign in my launcher?

This is a non issue triggered by the launcher failing to update the information file of a mod.

To fix this issue, in the launcher go to "All installed mods" tab and press "Reload all mods button" top right of the window.

Do you still have an issue ? Please read the [general procedure before reporting](/troubleshooting/procedure).
