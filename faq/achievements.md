# Crusader Kings III

Since Tours and Tournaments (v1.9), a modded CK3 game is compatible with achievements!

For more informations, check [CK3 wiki](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Achievements).

# Europa Universalis V

Due to changes in accessory_genes, the checksum of the game is modified, making the mod incompatible with achievements.
